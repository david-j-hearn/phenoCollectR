Description: Tools to model, simulate, and analyze phenological data obtained
  from biocollection records. Provides a unified framework to explore
  phenological extremes (first onset, last cessation, total phenophase duration
  in a population), phenophase onset, peak, and cessation timing, and the
  proportion of the population in the phenophase at a particular time. Includes
  methods for Bayesian MCMC, maximum likelihood, and MAP point estimation. Two
  models of phenological timing are currently implemented. The Gaussian process
  (GP) model defines onset as the first time a Gaussian process crosses a lower
  threshold, and cessation as the first time it crosses an upper threshold, with
  a single shared standard deviation parameter. The beta onset, beta duration
  (BB) model uses a beta distribution to model onset times and a second beta
  distribution to model durations, constrained such that onset plus duration
  falls within a fixed time window (e.g., a year). Mean onset and mean duration 
  can be modeled as linear functions of covariates in the GP model, enabling
  analysis of factors contributing to variation in onset, cessation, and
  duration.
